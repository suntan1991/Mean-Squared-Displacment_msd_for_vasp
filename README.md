# Mean-Squared-Displacment_msd_for_vasp
This is a python code written to calculate the Mean-Squared-Displacement (MSD) for ab-initio MD run in vasp.

Modified on Apr-28, 2018, Version3. This version takes sampling with a parameter in line 92. The last parameter can be adjusted to a bit larger one to spped up the computation.

Final MSD profile is very smooth after ensemble sampling. Feef free to practice with this one.
